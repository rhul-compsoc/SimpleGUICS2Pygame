Compatibility
=============

Compatibility between SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor and SimpleGUICS2Pygame
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* With SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor_ or CodeSkulptor3_,
  some things (like fonts, buttonsâ€¦) are browser dependents.
  That is to say that there are some differences from one browser to another.
  Therefore it is normal that these elements are also slightly different with SimpleGUICS2Pygame.

* With SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor_ or CodeSkulptor3_,
  supported sound formats (WAV, OGG, MP3)
  are also browser dependents.

  With SimpleGUICS2Pygame WAV, OGG and MP3 (since version 02.00.00) are supported.

  I recommend to always use the OGG format.

* .. warning::
    With SimpleGUICS2Pygame,
    ``Frame.start()`` is blocking
    until ``Frame.stop()`` execution or closing window.
    So timers must be started *before*, and states must be initialized *before*.
    (Or maybe after by a handler function.)

* .. warning::
    With SimpleGUICS2Pygame,
    if your program is terminated,
    then windows opened by
    ``plot_bars()``, ``plot_lines()`` and ``plot_scatter()``
    will be closed automatically.
    You can use the specific function ``_block()``
    to block the program until closing all windows.

* See Tips_ to run specific code.

Compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3
-------------------------------------------

CodeSkulptor_ implements a subset of Python 2.

CodeSkulptor3_ implements a subset of Python 3.

You can use SimpleGUICS2Pygame with Python 2 and Python 3.

* The division ``/`` don't have the same behavior in Python 2 and Python 3:
  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#integers .

  * In Python 2 (and CodeSkulptor): ``3/2 == 1`` and ``3/2.0 == 1.5``
  * In Python 3: ``3/2 == 3/2.0 == 1.5``

  ``3//2 == 1`` and ``3//2.0 == 1.0`` **everywehre**.

  (You can add
  ``from __future__ import division``
  *on the top* of your program, and Python 2 mimic Python 3 division.
  But then *CodeSkulptor failed*!)

* Rounded behavior is also different:
  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#builtins .

  * In Python 2 (and CodeSkulptor): ``round(1.5) == 2.0`` and ``round(2.5) == 3.0``
  * In Python 3: ``round(1.5) == round(2.5) == 2``

* ``print`` is a function in Python 3:
  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function .

  * In Python 2 (and CodeSkulptor): ``print 'Hello real world!', 42``
  * In Python 3: ``print('Hello real world!', 42)``

  With only one argument, ``print('Hello real world! ' + str(42))`` run **everywhere**.

  (You can add
  ``from __future__ import print_function``
  *on the top* of your program, and Python 2 mimic Python 3 print function.
  But then *CodeSkulptor failed*!)

Compatibility between CodeSkulptor and CodeSkulptor3
----------------------------------------------------

CodeSkulptor_ implements a subset of Python 2.

CodeSkulptor3_ implements a subset of Python 3.

There are moreover some other differences.

* In ``simplegui module`` module of CodeSkulptor3 and SimpleGUICS2Pygame,
  there is a ``Canvas.draw_arc()`` method
  that doesn't exist in CodeSkulptor2.

* In ``simplegui module`` module of CodeSkulptor3 and SimpleGUICS2Pygame,
  there is a ``Frame.download_canvas_image()`` method
  that doesn't exist in CodeSkulptor2.

* In ``numeric`` module of CodeSkulptor 2 and SimpleGUICS2Pygame,
  there is a ``Matric.scale()`` method
  to multiply the matrix by a scalar
  and the operator ``*`` multiply two matrices.

  In CodeSkulptor3,
  the ``Matric.scale()`` method doesn't exist,
  the operator ``*`` multiply a matrix by a scalar
  and the operator ``@`` multiply two matrices.
